# First-websites-layouts
Website layouts that i made studying for 2 months
the "website" is the first one that i made, the "grid2" was the second, and the latest is "layout5"
yes, i didn't give attention to the footer, my bad. but i hope you guys enjoy it, and if u are new too, i hope i serve as an inspiration for you to enter in this world of development.
